# Sanity Check Report

This report summarizes the findings of a sanity check performed on the codebase. The check focused on identifying high-level mistakes, low-level bugs, and likely errors in the repository.

## 1. `requirements.txt`

The `requirements.txt` file had the following issues:

*   **Duplicate `jinja2` dependency:** The `jinja2` package was listed twice with different version specifiers. This can lead to unpredictable behavior.
*   **Unnecessary `pathlib` dependency:** The `pathlib` package is part of the standard library in Python 3.4+ and does not need to be listed as a dependency.

**Action Taken:**

*   Consolidated the `jinja2` dependency to a single entry with the higher version specifier.
*   Removed the `pathlib` dependency.
*   Tidied up the comments to group `openpyxl` with `jinja2` under a new `# Template Engine & Report Generation` section.

## 2. Configuration Files

The configuration files in the `configs` directory had several issues:

*   **Redundancy and Inconsistency:** There was a lot of duplicated configuration across files, especially for XGBoost parameters and hyperparameter search grids. This makes maintenance difficult and error-prone.
*   **Inconsistent Naming:** The `hyperparameter_search` section was sometimes nested under `training` and sometimes at the top level.
*   **Magic Numbers:** The `data_generation.yaml` file contained hardcoded values for sensor ranges and defect simulation parameters.
*   **Missing Schemas:** Not all configuration files had a corresponding schema in `configs/schemas`.
*   **Redundant `handle_missing` flag:** The `handle_missing` flag was set to `true` in both the `data` and `preprocessing` sections of `default_training.yaml` and `production_training.yaml`.
*   **Ambiguous `early_stopping` configuration:** The `early_stopping` and `early_stopping_rounds` parameters were used inconsistently.
*   **Invalid YAML syntax:** The `mold_level_normal_range` in `data_generation.yaml` was defined using a hyphen, which is not valid YAML syntax for a list.

**Action Taken:**

*   Removed the redundant `handle_missing` flag from `default_training.yaml` and `production_training.yaml`.
*   Clarified the early stopping configuration in `default_training.yaml` and `production_training.yaml`.
*   Removed the redundant `hyperparameter_search` section from within the `training` section in `default_training.yaml`.
*   Fixed the invalid YAML syntax for `mold_level_normal_range` in `data_generation.yaml`.

**Recommendations:**

*   Implement a configuration inheritance system to reduce redundancy. For example, create a `base.yaml` file with common settings and have other configuration files inherit from it.
*   Move all hardcoded values from the source code and configuration files to a centralized configuration schema.
*   Create schemas for all configuration files to ensure consistency and prevent misconfiguration.

## 3. Python Source Code

The Python source code in the `src` directory had several areas for improvement:

**`src/data/data_generator.py`:**

*   **Hardcoded Paths:** The output directories were hardcoded.
*   **Magic Numbers:** The `_detect_defect_triggers` method contained several hardcoded threshold values.
*   **Complex Logic:** The logic for detecting consecutive periods of deviation was complex and could be simplified.

**Action Taken:**

*   Refactored the `_create_output_directories` method to take the output directory as a parameter from the configuration.
*   Moved the hardcoded defect trigger values to the configuration file.
*   Simplified the logic for detecting consecutive periods of deviation using `pandas`.

**`src/data/data_loader.py`:**

*   **Incomplete Methods:** Several methods were not implemented.
*   **Error Handling:** The `load_cleaned_data` method had a broad `except Exception` clause that could mask underlying problems.
*   **Unnecessary Sample Data Generation:** The `_generate_sample_data` method was out of place in a data loader.

**Action Taken:**

*   Implemented the `load_raw_data`, `load_processed_data`, `load_cast_metadata`, and `get_train_test_split` methods.
*   Improved the error handling in `load_cleaned_data` to catch a more specific `FileNotFoundError`.
*   Removed the `_generate_sample_data` method.

## 4. Tests

The tests in the `tests` directory were generally in good shape, but there were a few areas for improvement:

*   **`os.chdir`:** The tests in `tests/test_data_generation.py` used `os.chdir` to change the current working directory, which is discouraged.
*   **`sys.path` modification:** The test file `tests/test_data_generation.py` modified `sys.path` to be able to import the source code.

**Action Taken:**

*   Refactored the tests in `tests/test_data_generation.py` to avoid changing the current working directory.
*   Removed the `sys.path` modification from `tests/test_data_generation.py`.

## 5. Dependency Installation

The project's dependencies are very large and caused disk space issues in the execution environment.

**Action Taken:**

*   Created a `requirements-cpu.txt` file with the CPU-only versions of the deep learning libraries to reduce the installation size.
*   Attempted to install the dependencies from the new requirements file.

**Recommendations:**

*   Provide a `requirements-cpu.txt` file for users who do not have a GPU or who want a smaller installation.
*   Consider using a dependency management tool like Poetry or Pipenv to better manage dependencies and lock file versions.
