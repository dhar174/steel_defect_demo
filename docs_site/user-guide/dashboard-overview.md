# Dashboard Overview

## Introduction

The Steel Defect Detection Dashboard provides a comprehensive interface for
monitoring continuous steel casting processes and predicting quality defects
in real-time. This guide covers all aspects of using the dashboard effectively.

## Getting Started

### Accessing the Dashboard

The dashboard is accessible through a web browser at the configured URL.
Default local access is typically available at:

```text
http://localhost:8501
```

### Authentication

Currently, the dashboard operates in demonstration mode without authentication
requirements. In production deployments, appropriate access controls should
be implemented.
