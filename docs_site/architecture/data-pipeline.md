# Data Pipeline

The data pipeline manages the flow of sensor data from collection to storage and processing.

## Overview

Data flows through multiple stages:

1. Sensor data collection
2. Real-time validation
3. Preprocessing and cleaning  
4. Storage in time-series database
5. Analytics and reporting

## Pipeline Components

### Data Ingestion

- Real-time sensor feeds
- Batch data imports
- Data validation rules

### Processing Engine

- Stream processing with Apache Kafka
- Data transformation pipelines
- Quality assessment algorithms

### Storage Layer

- Time-series database (InfluxDB)
- Relational database (PostgreSQL)
- Object storage for models and reports
