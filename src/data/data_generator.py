        Implementation Overview:
            This method generates synthetic time series data for a steel casting process
            based on the configuration provided during initialization. The data includes
            process parameters (e.g., temperature, pressure) and timestamps.

        Generate a complete synthetic dataset for steel casting processes.
        
        This method is intended to create a dataset containing synthetic time-series data
        for multiple steel casting sequences. The dataset will be generated based on the
        configuration parameters provided during the initialization of the class.
        
        Workflow:
        - Iterate over a predefined number of casting sequences.
        - For each sequence, call the `generate_cast_sequence` method to generate time-series data.
        - Aggregate the data into a single dataset.
        - Save the dataset to a file or return it as a DataFrame.
        
        Expected Outputs:
        - A complete synthetic dataset in the form of a Pandas DataFrame or saved to a file.
        
        Note:
        This method is currently a placeholder and requires implementation.
