## Usage Instructions

### View Sub-Issues
```bash
# View summary of all sub-issues
python scripts/issue_manager.py --generate-sub-issues

# Export to JSON for programmatic use
python scripts/issue_manager.py --export-json --output-file custom_output.json

# Export to Markdown for documentation
python scripts/issue_manager.py --export-markdown --output-file custom_output.md
```

### Create GitHub Issues
```bash
# Install GitHub CLI if not already installed
# Follow instructions at: https://cli.github.com/

# Authenticate with GitHub
gh auth login

# Run the generated script to create all sub-issues
./scripts/create_phase6_issues.sh
```

### Individual Issue Creation
If you prefer to create issues individually, you can extract specific commands from `create_phase6_issues.sh` or use the JSON data to create issues through the GitHub API.

## Integration with Parent Issue

Each sub-issue includes:
- Reference to parent issue #10
- Direct link to parent issue URL
- Consistent labeling with "Phase 6" tag
- Milestone assignment to "Phase 6: Production Deployment"

## Quality Assurance

All sub-issues include:
- **Comprehensive Acceptance Criteria**: 8-10 specific, testable criteria per issue
- **Testing Requirements**: Unit, integration, performance, and security testing
- **Definition of Done**: 9-point checklist ensuring production readiness
- **Resource References**: Links to relevant documentation and parent issue
- **Prerequisites Mapping**: Clear dependency relationships between sub-issues

## Development Workflow

Recommended implementation order based on dependencies:

1. **Foundation** (No dependencies):
   - 6.1 Containerization and Orchestration

2. **Core Infrastructure** (Depends on 6.1):
   - 6.2 Production API Services
   - 6.3 Database Integration and Data Management
   - 6.7 Configuration Management and Secrets

3. **Supporting Systems** (Depends on core):
   - 6.4 Monitoring and Observability Stack
   - 6.5 Security and Access Control
   - 6.6 CI/CD Pipeline and Automation

4. **Operational Tools** (Depends on infrastructure):
   - 6.8 Operational Tools and Maintenance

5. **Advanced Features** (Depends on full stack):
   - 6.9 Industrial Integration Connectors
   - 6.10 Edge Computing Deployment
   - 6.11 Multi-Site Deployment Management

## Maintenance

The `issue_manager.py` script can be modified to:
- Add new sub-issues if requirements change
- Update acceptance criteria based on implementation feedback
- Regenerate exports with updated content
- Extend functionality for other phases or projects
