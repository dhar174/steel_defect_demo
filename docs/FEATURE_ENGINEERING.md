# Feature Engineering Pipeline Implementation

## Overview

This implementation provides a comprehensive feature engineering pipeline for steel casting defect prediction. The pipeline extracts 100+ meaningful features from time series sensor data across 5 sensor channels.

## Implementation Summary

### Core Components

1. **CastingFeatureEngineer** (`src/features/feature_engineer.py`)
   - Main feature extraction class
   - Extracts 100 features across 5 categories
   - Supports batch processing with parallel execution
   - Includes feature scaling and normalization

2. **FeatureValidator** (`src/features/feature_validation.py`)
   - Data quality validation
   - Feature completeness checking
   - Correlation analysis for feature selection

3. **Utility Functions** (`src/features/feature_utils.py`)
   - Helper functions for statistical calculations
   - Spike detection and trend analysis
   - Safe correlation computation

### Feature Categories

| Category | Count | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| Statistical | 45 | Mean, std, min, max, median + 4 percentiles × 5 sensors |
| Stability | 20 | Spike count, excursion frequency, CV, range ratio × 5 sensors |
| Duration | 15 | Time at extremes, threshold crossings, consecutive extremes × 5 sensors |
| Interaction | 10 | Cross-sensor correlations, ratios, differences |
| Temporal | 10 | Linear trend, mean gradient × 5 sensors |
| **Total** | **100** | **Complete feature set for ML model training** |

### Sensor Channels

- `temperature`: Steel temperature readings
- `pressure`: Mold pressure measurements  
- `flow_rate`: Cooling water flow rate
- `vibration`: Equipment vibration levels
- `power_consumption`: Power consumption metrics

## Usage Examples

### Basic Feature Extraction

```python
from src.features.feature_engineer import CastingFeatureEngineer
import pandas as pd

# Initialize engineer
engineer = CastingFeatureEngineer()

# Load casting data
data = pd.read_csv('casting_data.csv')

# Extract features
features = engineer.engineer_features(data, cast_id='cast_001')
print(f"Extracted {len(features.columns)} features")
```

### Batch Processing

```python
# Process multiple casts
data_dict = {
    'cast_001': data1,
    'cast_002': data2,
    'cast_003': data3
}

all_features = engineer.engineer_features_batch(data_dict, n_jobs=-1)
```

### Feature Scaling

```python
# Fit scaler on training data
engineer.fit_scaler(training_features)

# Scale new features
scaled_features = engineer.scale_features(new_features)
```

### Data Validation

```python
from src.features.feature_validation import FeatureValidator

validator = FeatureValidator()

# Validate input data
input_validation = validator.validate_input_data(raw_data)

# Validate extracted features
feature_validation = validator.validate_features(features)

# Check for highly correlated features
correlation_analysis = validator.check_feature_correlations(features)
```

## Configuration

Configuration is managed through `configs/feature_engineering.yaml`:

```yaml
feature_engineering:
  sensor_columns:
    - temperature
    - pressure
    - flow_rate
    - vibration
    - power_consumption
  
  statistical_features:
    percentiles: [10, 25, 75, 90]
    
  stability_features:
    spike_threshold: 2.0
    
  duration_features:
    extreme_percentiles: [5, 95]
    
  scaling:
    method: "standard"  # standard, robust, none
    
  validation:
    min_data_points: 50
    max_missing_ratio: 0.1
```

## Performance Characteristics
