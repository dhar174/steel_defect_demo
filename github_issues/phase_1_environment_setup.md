# Phase 1: Environment Setup and Project Foundation

## Description

This phase establishes the foundational development environment and project structure for the Predictive Quality Monitoring System. This is the first critical step that enables all subsequent development phases.

## Context

From the Technical Design specification, this phase involves creating a robust Python environment with all necessary dependencies, establishing a proper project structure, and setting up development workflows that will support both the baseline machine learning models and deep sequence models.

## Objectives

- Set up a complete Python development environment with all required libraries
- Establish a clean, maintainable project directory structure
- Configure version control and development workflows
- Prepare the foundation for data generation, model development, and real-time inference

## Acceptance Criteria

### Environment Setup
- [ ] Create Python virtual environment (Python 3.8+)
- [ ] Install core dependencies:
  - `pandas` (data manipulation)
  - `numpy` (numerical computing)
  - `scikit-learn` (machine learning utilities)
  - `xgboost` or `lightgbm` (gradient boosting)
  - `pytorch` (deep learning)
  - `plotly` and `dash` (visualization, optional)
  - `pyyaml` (configuration management)
- [ ] Create `requirements.txt` with pinned versions
- [ ] Verify all installations work correctly

### Project Structure
- [ ] Create organized directory structure:
  ```
  steel_defect_demo/
  ├── data/               # Raw and processed datasets
  ├── models/             # Trained model artifacts
  ├── src/                # Source code modules
  ├── notebooks/          # Jupyter notebooks for EDA
  ├── configs/            # Configuration files
  ├── tests/              # Unit tests
  ├── docs/               # Documentation
  └── requirements.txt    # Dependencies
  ```
- [ ] Add appropriate `.gitignore` file
- [ ] Create initial configuration files structure

### Version Control
- [ ] Ensure Git repository is properly initialized
- [ ] Create development branch structure if needed
- [ ] Add appropriate Git hooks or workflows

### Documentation
- [ ] Update project README with setup instructions
- [ ] Document environment setup process
- [ ] Create development guidelines

## Implementation Tasks

### Core Dependencies Installation
```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install core packages
pip install pandas>=1.3.0
pip install numpy>=1.21.0
pip install scikit-learn>=1.0.0
pip install xgboost>=1.5.0
pip install torch>=1.10.0
pip install plotly>=5.0.0
pip install dash>=2.0.0
pip install pyyaml>=6.0.0

# Additional utilities
pip install jupyter
pip install matplotlib
pip install seaborn
```

### Directory Structure Creation
```bash
mkdir -p data/{raw,processed,synthetic}
mkdir -p models/{baseline,sequence,artifacts}
mkdir -p src/{data_processing,modeling,inference,utils}
mkdir -p notebooks
mkdir -p configs
mkdir -p tests
mkdir -p docs
```

### Configuration Files
- [ ] Create `config.yaml` template for system parameters
- [ ] Create `logging.conf` for structured logging
- [ ] Create `.env.example` for environment variables

## Dependencies

- **Prerequisite**: Access to development machine with Python 3.8+
- **Blocks**: All subsequent phases depend on this foundation

## Expected Deliverables

1. **Functional Python Environment**: Complete virtual environment with all dependencies installed and tested
2. **Project Structure**: Clean, organized directory layout following best practices
3. **Configuration Framework**: Basic configuration management setup
4. **Documentation**: Setup instructions and development guidelines
5. **Version Control**: Proper Git setup with appropriate ignore patterns

## Technical Considerations

### Python Environment
- Use virtual environment to isolate dependencies
- Pin specific versions to ensure reproducibility
- Consider using `requirements-dev.txt` for development-only dependencies

### Project Organization
- Follow Python packaging best practices
- Separate source code from data and models
- Create modular structure to support microservices architecture

### Cross-Platform Compatibility
- Ensure setup works on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- Use relative paths and environment variables where appropriate
- Document platform-specific setup differences

## Success Metrics

- [ ] Environment setup can be completed in < 15 minutes following documentation
- [ ] All dependencies install without conflicts
- [ ] Project structure supports clean imports and modular development
- [ ] Basic "hello world" scripts can run successfully in each main directory

## Notes

This foundational phase is critical for all subsequent development. Take time to establish a clean, maintainable setup that will scale as the project grows. The modular structure established here will directly support the microservices architecture outlined in the technical specification.
