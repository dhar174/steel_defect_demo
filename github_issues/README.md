## Usage

Each markdown file in this directory represents a complete GitHub issue that can be created by copying the content and creating a new issue in the repository. The issues are designed to be comprehensive and include:

- Detailed description of the phase
- Specific acceptance criteria
- Implementation tasks and subtasks
- Dependencies on other phases
- Expected deliverables
- Technical requirements and considerations

## Creating the Issues

1. Copy the content from each markdown file
2. Create a new GitHub issue
3. Use the suggested title from the file
